# Learning Functional Transduction
This repository contains the code to replicate results from v. Specifically, it contains the scripts allowing to meta-learn solutions of the four presented experiments:
 - Regression of 1D Advection-Diffusion-Reaction equations
 - Regression of 2D Burgers systems with varying diffusion coefficients
 - Prediction of climate variable under seasonal influence
 - Classification of MNIST-like datasets  
 
The code is written in __Python__ and use Pytorch for dataset sampling and model definition. 
Data is accessible at the following [(to come)]():
